# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Description
This project introduces basic JavaScript concepts. It focuses on writing scripts, understanding variables, loops, functions, and working with arguments. The tasks aim to prepare you for more advanced JavaScript programming.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of JavaScript programming.
- Use `console.log` to print outputs.
- Work with command-line arguments using `process.argv`.
- Use loops, conditionals, and functions effectively in JavaScript.
- Differentiate between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Write clean and semistandard-compliant JavaScript code.

---

## Project Requirements

- All scripts are run with Node.js (`#!/usr/bin/node`).
- No use of `var`; use `let` or `const` instead.
- Code should pass semistandard style checks.
- You must not use `try/catch` for argument checking.
- Functions must follow the required prototypes and be visible from outside.
